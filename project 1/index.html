<h2 align="center"><b>Iceland</b></h2>
<br><b>
<i>Iceland</i>
</b> is a country of a sharp contrast. A place where fire and ice co-exist. Where dark winters
are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country where insular existance has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.

<p style="margin-left:3%">The Aurora takes its name from the Roman godess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name
for the north wind, Boreas. From September to April, Iceland is a host for this magnificent lightshow.
<br>The Aurora Borealis, most commenly referred to as The Northern Lights is a natural
phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnificent feild.
This releases energy, causing peculiar lumibous green streaks across the sky.</p>

<br>
<figcaption>
<p style="margin-left:3%">When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's namesake- namely, it is 4,500
square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes place mainly on the Solheimajokull and Svinafellsjokull
glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik (and Skaftafell).</p>
