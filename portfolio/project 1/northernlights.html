    <p><i>THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA borealis,</i> or the northern lights, being high in the Earth's
    atmosphere- at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles- when changed particles from the sun
  become trapped in the Earth's magnetic field. The result is a colorful, dancing light show.
<br>
<br> The first time i filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica. Luckily, there are much more
 accessable places if you'd like to take in these light shows yourself. For the best seats for this celestial scene,
consider anywhere with a magnetic altitude abouve 55 degrees and low light pollution. Find your magnetic altitude on NOAA and here.
<br>
<br>In the polar altitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nighta are good but not necissarily the best
time. Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth's magnetic field lets more solar particles interact with the atmosphere, creating ayrora seasons!
I suggest autumnal equinox in September, when there are pleasent temperatures in polar latitudes. Fine the dark hours of your location here, or by using the sky guide app. </p>
